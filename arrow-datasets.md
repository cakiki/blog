# Data Analytics with Apache Arrow and Hugging Face Datasets

<!-- {blog_metadata} -->
<!-- {authors} -->

Hugging Face Datasets is a library that was designed to complement machine learning training workflows. It enables users to share, download, process, and format datasets to get them ready for training with any of the major machine learning frameworks, across all data modalities: audio, video, text, and tabular. The ðŸ¤— `datasets` library is typically the first entrypoint of a machine learning project: it is therefore especially crucial it be performant and efficient.

One of the many strengths of ðŸ¤— `datasets` is its ability to [quickly and efficiently](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/about_arrow) handle data that is too large fit into system memory. This is made possible by using Apache Arrow as its underlying memory model. This post will showcase the synergies between the two projects, and how using the Arrow ecosystem can supercharge your library, giving you access to more features than you initially bargained for. We will show you how you can use ðŸ¤— `datasets` for out-of-core data analytics to better understand your data, ahead of using it to train a model.

## Apache Arrow
According to the [official website](https://arrow.apache.org/), Apache Arrow is a colum-oriented **standardized memory format**, a set of **libraries** that implement said format and various utilities around it, and an **ecosystem** of projects using them. ðŸ¤— `datasets` is one of many projects of this ecosystem and leverage the Arrow memory format through the use of the `pyarrow` library: the official Python API of Apache Arrow.

### Arrow Tables

### The Arrow Compute API

### Hugging Face Dataset Formats

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dset = load_dataset("cakiki/stack-smol-xxl", split="train")
print(dset.num_rows, " rows")
print(dset.dataset_size / 1024**3, " GB")
>>> 12,962,249 rows
>>> 66.9516989979893 GB
```

## Mapping Compute Primitives

Scratchpad: synergy between the two libraries. success story of arrow. Come for the memory model / mmapping, stay for the data analytics.
